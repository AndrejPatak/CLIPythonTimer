# SimplePythonTimer
This is a simple CLI python script that lets you set a timer. 
Works for linux and windows, I think. If it's broken for you, please say so.

When the script is started follow the "instructions" that are outputted.
Hope someone finds this useful in any way even tho far better options exist.
Have a nice day!
